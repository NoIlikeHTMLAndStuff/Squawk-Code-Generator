# Aviation Squawk Code Generator

A professional web application for generating valid aviation squawk codes (transponder codes) for training and educational purposes.

## Features

- üõ©Ô∏è **Valid Code Generation**: Creates 4-digit octal codes (0-7 digits only)
- üö® **Emergency Code Protection**: Automatically excludes emergency codes (7500, 7600, 7700)
- ‚è∞ **Automatic Expiry**: Codes expire after 10 minutes to prevent conflicts
- üìã **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying with visual confirmation
- üåô **Dark/Light Mode**: Smooth theme switching with enhanced transitions
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- üìä **Real-time History**: Live tracking of active codes with countdown timers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui styling
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. **Generate Codes**: Click "Generate New Code" to create a valid squawk code
2. **View History**: Check the "Active Codes" tab to see all current codes with timers
3. **Copy Codes**: Click the copy button to copy codes to your clipboard
4. **Clear All**: Use "Clear All" to remove all active codes at once

## Safety & Compliance

- All generated codes comply with aviation standards
- Emergency codes (7500, 7600, 7700) are never generated
- Codes use only valid octal digits (0-7)
- Automatic expiry prevents code conflicts
